My name is Zhenyuan Ma, and I am a dedicated and curious learner with a strong foundation in data analysis, interdisciplinary research, and project management. Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate studies in Information Systems at the [State University of New York at Stony Brook](https://stonybrook.edu/), building on my academic background in Digital Media Technology from [Anhui University](https://en.ahu.edu.cn/) that is part of [the Double First-Class Construction](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/8/6378) and [Project 211](https://korea.lxgz.org.cn/korea/zls/xmgc/2009011510231092072/index.html). And I will receive a Bachelor of STEM degree from the State University of New York and Anhui University in 2025. This unique combination of technical expertise and creative insight has shaped my academic journey and professional aspirations, driving me to explore innovative solutions that harness the power of computer technology and artificial intelligence.

During my undergraduate life, I learned advanced courses that developed my digital technology and problem-solving competency. At Anhui University, I learned Database Design, Operating Systems, and Human-Computer Interaction, and advanced courses like Scripting Languages and Python-Fintech with AI & Cloud at Stony Brook University, cementing my focus on fintech and cloud computing. A pivotal experience was my participatiom of the project on [high-performance manufacturing of diesel/biodiesel](https://doi.org/10.1080/10916466.2019.1594284) under Dr. Sun, where I gained my analytical competency through exploratory data analysis. My experience as an Intern of Information Security Engineering at Beijing CNPC Information Technology Ltd. and Investment Analysis Intern at CNPC Consulting Center entailed protocols of security and management of big data. A national innovation project also honed my teamwork and strategic problem-solving skill set. Following Stony Brook, I will continue on to a master's degree integrating AI, digital media, and cloud technology innovation.
